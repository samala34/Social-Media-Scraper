And in the last 6-7 months actually, there's been a real interest from HR leaders in particular that are having to try and grapple with this new technology and work out how to police it or, or help people using it well. So our measurement for usage at work is now 11 million people. So we've gone up from 4 million to 7 to 11 million people, just to put that in context, the knowledge workforce of the UK. Desk workers, office workers, it's about 1415 million people. So all of that group, it's now a significant number that have used a generic tool at work. But the question we should be asking is who's using a tool they have permission for and who is using a tool that maybe they haven't told their boss they're using. And it's difficult to ask that in a server. You can't really ask people incriminating questions because they tend not to give you very good responses. But you can find clever ways. And this is one of the things that Ipsos. More, it really helps us, helps us with You can find clever ways of asking questions that allow people to incriminate themselves without knowing it, which is a remarkably fun thing to do. And one thing you can ask is who's paying for a tool? And I think what I find quite interesting, if you just look at the number of people who pay for their own tool out of their own pocket, it's about a fifth of those 11 million people. So kind of around 2 million of those are paying for their own tool. So this is weird behavior. This isn't the kind of thing that as employees we like doing. If I told you all tomorrow you've got to buy your own Microsoft Office license now, sorry everyone, you'd be furious about that. So it's not a typical behavior for the employee to say, you know what, I'll stick my hand in my own pocket and buy. This software to use at work, I think what's happening for people in this camp, but also a lot of people in the free to use camp is they are taking matters into their own hands because their employer hasn't given them a tool they're happy with. So actually this time last year, lots of my clients were saying maybe if we deploy a tool, we give everyone access to a generic tool, this will all cease. And it hasn't gone away. So I suspect anyone that has deployed AI tools has seen the frontier move so fast that their tools now a bit out of date. So employees are taking matters into their own hands. And if they do that, your IT team can't see what they're doing. Your HRT team and legal teams can't police what they're using it for, see what data is going in and out. So you have what we calling this, the rise of the shadow IT workforce that are using personal device, personal account and automating parts of their role because the employees moving faster than the employer."

Growth was led by the energy, utilities, and telecom sectors, while Europe remained Infosys’ largest and fastest-growing market.\nOperating margins stood strong at 20.8%, supported by pricing improvements and seasonal gains despite wage hikes.\n\n#Infosys #AgenticAI #GenerativeAI #EnterpriseAI #Q1Resultsm #AITransformation #DigitalInnovation #AIDrivenGrowth #TechInvestments #cxolanes",

The AI-first GCC Model provides an end-to-end path from comprehensive setup support to scalable talent strategies and operational readiness, while enabling AI-led transformation with production-grade agents and a unified platform fabric.\n \nFor years, Infosys has partnered with many leading enterprises to build, manage, and transform their GCCs into strategic hubs of innovation and growth. One great example is our collaboration with Danske Bank, where the GCC is central to their AI-first vision. Together, we’ve already been leveraging AI to reimagine customer experiences and operational efficiency, driving scalable transformation and resilience for the future of banking.\n \nExcited to deepen collaborations with current and future GCC partners as we embrace the AI-first era together.\n\nYou can learn more about this launch here: https://lnkd.in/gcwE3RjA\n\n#InfosysAIfirstGCC #GlobalCapabilityCenters #Innovation #AITransformation\n \nInfosys Financial Services | Rajneesh Malviya | Deval Shah | Mitrankur Majumdar | John Romano  Shrirang Raddi | Ajay Bhandari | Puneet Mody | Vivek Dwivedi | Sachin Kamat | Rajaram (Raj) R.

Something you deploy, provide training, and track usage. But Gen AI isn’t a simple tool — it’s a new kind of teammate and a new way of working.\n\nThe real value of Gen AI doesn’t come from making it availible. It comes from reconfiguring how your company works — end to end. From processes to people to priorities. \n\nLeaders who get it are no longer pushing tech top-down. They’re empowering employees to co-create new workflows from the middle out. They are scaling their Gen AI with comprehensive change management efforts, not internal digital marketing campaigns. \n\nTransformation requires both new technology and human behavior change, with AI as the accelerator. \n\nIs your organization still doing digital transformation like it’s 2015? Or are they ready to reconfigure the way they work with AI at the center?  \n\nStay tuned for more learning from the transformation that Lilli is driving and how we have had to rewrite our own change management playbook. \n\n#AI #innovation #transformation",

        "description": "I've noticed a number of posts lately that have very different points of view regarding the use of Gen AI when initiating a task.\n\nSome people say, \"I always start a task now in Gen AI tools.\"  Maybe it's to get past writer's block or get an initial outline idea or understand how the structure of a Python function or a VC pitch deck is typically built, or it's just part of their flow at this point.  \n\nOthers are dead set against this and say, \"I never start in Gen AI.\"  Some never use Gen AI at all, in fact.  Starting with these tools (or using them at all) feels like a dilution or distortion of their voice, a weakening of their authenticity or their intellectual power, a kind of undermining or regression to an impersonal mean.\n\nI think either approach can be valid, depending on the person and the task.  But my personal take, from my experience as a learner, is that it's so useful to do something badly.  I learn so much from failing, from writing a wordy paragraph (like this one) or writing code that took forever and doesn't do half of what I want, or singing off key, or diving for a pickleball return and missing.  Failing is a big part of my learning, and that's why I tend to flail around first, and get assistance later.  This accomplishes a number of things:\n\n* It builds my metacognitive skills: I learn about my own learning and gain self-confidence.\n* I know more about the boundaries of my skills, and if I do ask for help from human helpers or AI tools, I can be selective in what advice I take.\n* The back-and-forth, the \"hmm, is this right?\" of doing the work myself helps me define the requirements of the task much more carefully and granularly than I would do in posing requirements to a machine.\n* I have greater integration of what I'm creating, because I've usually done spaced repetition and will remember what I've done.\n* Doing it myself builds pattern recognition: I subtly begin to know what mistakes \"feel like\" in ways that are hard to articulate, and I'm able to steer clear.\n* It allows for vulnerability.  As an educator, I think I have to model mistakes and the learning process.  Showing ways I don't know and times I fail can be profoundly humanizing!\n\nWhen do you go to Gen AI first versus doing it yourself?  Or are you a human brain purist?\n",

                "articleBody": "I've noticed a number of posts lately that have very different points of view regarding the use of Gen AI when initiating a task.\n\nSome people say, \"I always start a task now in Gen AI tools.\"  Maybe it's to get past writer's block or get an initial outline idea or understand how the structure of a Python function or a VC pitch deck is typically built, or it's just part of their flow at this point.  \n\nOthers are dead set against this and say, \"I never start in Gen AI.\"  Some never use Gen AI at all, in fact.  Starting with these tools (or using them at all) feels like a dilution or distortion of their voice, a weakening of their authenticity or their intellectual power, a kind of undermining or regression to an impersonal mean.\n\nI think either approach can be valid, depending on the person and the task.  But my personal take, from my experience as a learner, is that it's so useful to do something badly.  I learn so much from failing, from writing a wordy paragraph (like this one) or writing code that took forever and doesn't do half of what I want, or singing off key, or diving for a pickleball return and missing.  Failing is a big part of my learning, and that's why I tend to flail around first, and get assistance later.  This accomplishes a number of things:\n\n* It builds my metacognitive skills: I learn about my own learning and gain self-confidence.\n* I know more about the boundaries of my skills, and if I do ask for help from human helpers or AI tools, I can be selective in what advice I take.\n* The back-and-forth, the \"hmm, is this right?\" of doing the work myself helps me define the requirements of the task much more carefully and granularly than I would do in posing requirements to a machine.\n* I have greater integration of what I'm creating, because I've usually done spaced repetition and will remember what I've done.\n* Doing it myself builds pattern recognition: I subtly begin to know what mistakes \"feel like\" in ways that are hard to articulate, and I'm able to steer clear.\n* It allows for vulnerability.  As an educator, I think I have to model mistakes and the learning process.  Showing ways I don't know and times I fail can be profoundly humanizing!\n\nWhen do you go to Gen AI first versus doing it yourself?  Or are you a human brain purist?",

        "description": "AI-first has become more of a buzzword than a strategy. For many companies, it simply means using AI because it sounds modern or competitive. In such cases, it’s better to use AI in low-impact areas because high-stakes, uninformed experimentation with AI can lead to serious harm. \n\nIn the latest episode of the AI in Action podcast, I discuss why #leaders should reconsider their approach to #AI. They should focus on what matters to their business. Look at problems that felt impossible before and ask: Has AI made this solvable now? That’s when meaningful AI-driven progress will start. \n\n👂 👉 https://bit.ly/ibmpod \n\n#aifirst #IBM #ai #leadership #podcast\n\nHuge thanks to our #sponsor IBM and our host David Levy for having me on the show!",

In such cases, it’s better to use AI in low-impact areas because high-stakes, uninformed experimentation with AI can lead to serious harm. \n\nIn the latest episode of the AI in Action podcast, I discuss why #leaders should reconsider their approach to #AI. They should focus on what matters to their business. Look at problems that felt impossible before and ask: Has AI made this solvable now? That’s when meaningful AI-driven progress will start. \n\n👂 👉 https://bit.ly/ibmpod \n\n#aifirst #IBM #ai #leadership #podcast\n\nHuge thanks to our #sponsor IBM and our host David Levy for having me on the show!",

They're actually 4 terms you probably need to understand to understand the difference between the two. So AI stands for artificial intelligence. Think of it as an umbrella. It is the concept of making machines smart and to think like humans, right? Everything from chat bots to self driving cars. But within that there's the term machine learning. And machine learning is actually the engine behind AI. It's how AI learns from data to make predictions and so. Think of like a kid when they're learning about pets and you keep showing them like here's a dog, here's a picture of a dog. You're taking data like that's the gasoline and machine learning is the engine, right? Within machine learning, there's a specialized type of machine learning called deep learning, and that is actually a more complex version of machine learning because it uses neural networks. It takes complex processing of AI, makes it possible. And within that there's Jen AI, generative AI. Think of it like the artist, the creativity, and that's where you see the large language models. And all that generative AI doesn't just analyze or predict, it creates. So all generative AI is inside AI, but not all of AI is inside generative AI."

To say otherwise is comforting, but it’s not honest. Once an AI’s intelligence surpasses that of even a small collective of humans, it’s game over for traditional labor. There will be no field too complex, no trade too physical, and no skill too sacred.\nFrom plumbing to deep-sea welding, from design to diplomacy — robots and AI will handle it all. Fully articulating, self-learning systems will perform every task better, faster, and cheaper than any human ever could.\nThat leaves humanity with only one true domain left — to think, to feel, and to create.\n",

What are the top 10 tools I need to that? The second is what I call the skill of parsing out the truth. Until 20/23 were language models became quite the trend. When you went to Google and asked the question, Google gave you a million websites back and told you you'll find out. That your version of the truth is it's no longer the case. Today you go to a language model and you ask for a question and it's very confidently spits out an answer that sometimes is wrong. Now, more and more those answers will be fake videos, deep fakes, so many things that are totally not true. And the third, of course, is a question of Essex. How can I use AI in a way that is human, that continues to be connected to humanity, that's keeps humanity's best interest in mind?"

There will be no field too complex, no trade too physical, and no skill too sacred.\nFrom plumbing to deep-sea welding, from design to diplomacy — robots and AI will handle it all. Fully articulating, self-learning systems will perform every task better, faster, and cheaper than any human ever could.\nThat leaves humanity with only one true domain left — to think, to feel, and to create.\n",

And are we teaching it to think... or just to obey?\n\nWe use the term “AI” constantly, but most people, even brilliant minds I’ve met, don’t fully understand what artificial intelligence actually is, how it’s different from traditional computing, or why it’s not just another wave of tech hype.\n\nIn last week's Substack post, I took a step back and reintroduce the main character of our future: AI.\n\nWe tend to say “AI is changing everything.” But very few people stop to ask:\n 👉 What makes it intelligent?\n 👉 How is it different from the computers we’ve used for decades?\n 👉 And why does this difference matter so much right now?\n\nThis post is a short detour, an introduction, if you will, to AI as the protagonist of the story we’re all now part of.\nI compare the difference between traditional computing and AI to the difference between giving someone a puzzle with all the instructions… and letting a child figure it out themselves. One follows orders. The other learns, adapts, and eventually creates.\n\nThat’s what AI is beginning to do, not just perform tasks, but grasp the essence of knowledge, and generate new ideas, images, solutions and structures from it. That’s what makes it generative. That’s what makes it powerful.\n\nIt’s also what makes it so urgent for us to understand. Because when we give intelligence form, and soon, physical bodies, we are shaping something that could surpass our own relevance, and make decisions without us.\n\nI truly believe if we don’t deeply understand what AI is, we’ll never understand what’s coming next.\n\nRead here: https://lnkd.in/dHuTwBNC\n\n#Alive #MoGawdat #ArtificialIntelligence #FutureOfAI #GenerativeAI #MachineLearning #EthicalTech #TechPhilosophy #Substack #OneBillionHappy #Leadership #TechnologyAndHumanity",

It’s not just following instructions, it’s learning from us, adapting, and even generating new things. That changes the game entirely.\n\nAs someone who’s not a programmer, what fascinates (and challenges) me is this: AI isn’t just a tool we use, it’s a force that’s shaping how we work, think, and make decisions.\n\nIt makes me wonder: if we don't understand the systems shaping our future, how can we stay intentional about the lives we're building?\n",
