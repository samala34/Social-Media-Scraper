# Social Media Post Filtering Tool

This is a Streamlit-based web application that lets you upload CSV files
with social media posts and filter them by hashtags (Women's Day, AI, or custom)
and optional date filters (year, month).

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
